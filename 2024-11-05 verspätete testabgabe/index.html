                <p>You can use Pulse absolutely free for 30 days. After 30 days,
                    we will charge the credit card you used when you  sign up. If
                    you choose to cancel your account before your trial ends, your
                    card will not be charged </p>

                <h3> What is a “Financial Account”?</h3>
                <p>Financial Accounts are a grouping of income and expense
                    items that can be used for tracking or reporting purposes.</p>

                    <h3> Will | be able to cancel my account if I don't use Pulse?</h3>
                    <p>Yes - you can cancel your account at any time. To cancel your
                        account, go to your billing page and click on “Please cancel my
                        account” at the bottom of the page. The account owner is the
                        only one who can cancel an account. An email request to
                        delete an account is not considered cancellation.
